1. Alexander Merryfield
2. I am interested in learning how to solve large scale challanges and to be able to spot problems in large amounts of data. 
3. I took a couple of programing courses in college, but that was a very long time ago. I have used R in my job for about a year now, so while I am not an expert, I know my way around and have developed larger(relative to a beginner ~400 lines) applications using the language. I have never used Python. 
5.  No. As stated above, just with work in R and I have no experience in Python. 
6.  I would like to learn a solid foundation in both languages. While I have more experience in R, I am sure there are many things for me to learn that will be useful going forward. 
7.  I have nothing else to add other than I look forward to learning from everyone in the class.
